    "## try and except\n",
    "#### The basic terminology and syntax used to handle errors in Python are the try and except statements. The code which can cause an exception to occur is put in the try block and the handling of the exception is then implemented in the except block of code. The syntax follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### try: this is the block of code to be attempted(may lead to an error)\n",
    "#### except: Block of code will execute in case there is an error in try block\n",
    "#### finally : a final block of code to be executed, regardless of an error  \n",
    "#### \n",
    "#### We can also just check for any exception with just using except: To get a better understanding of all this let's check out an #### example: We will look at some code that opens and writes a file:"
